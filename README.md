# image-colorization
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that colorizes black-and-white images using a deep learning model with OpenCV’s DNN module. Users can upload grayscale images and view the colorized output in real time.
## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV (DNN module)
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Caffe (pre-trained colorization model
## Installation and Usage
